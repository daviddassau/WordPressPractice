# WordPressPractice

### Up and Running
- First, you need to install WAMP, if you're running Windows. MAMP if you're running on a Mac.
- Once you have WAMP or MAMP installed, you need to chose a parent theme for your Wordpress site.
- It also helps to have some sort of dummy data, so you can actually see changes made to your site.
