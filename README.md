# WordPressPractice

### Up and Running
- First, you need to install WAMP, if you're running Windows. MAMP if you're running on a Mac.
- Once you have WAMP or MAMP installed, you need to download a copy of the latest version of WordPress from Wordpress.org.
  - To get setup with Wordpress locally, navigate to where you installed WordPress on your computer.
  - Click on the zip folder > Wordpress > and select all files and copy.
  - Click on the WAMP icon, and go to www directory. From there, you can create a new folder, name it whatever your site/project is. Inside that folder, you'll paste in all of the copied WP files.
  - Then, in your browser, you can type in localhost/whateverYouNamedYourFolder, and this will bring you to the first WP page, where you select your language.
  - You then want to again click on the WAMP icon, click on phpMyAdmin, and log in. Once you're in, you want to create a new database, and call it the same thing that you called this project.
  - Once you've done that, you can go back to the window in your browser with WP. Run through the steps.
- Once you have that, you need to chose a parent theme for your Wordpress site.
- It also helps to have some sort of dummy data, so you can actually see changes made to your site.
  - HINT: You can Google "Wordpress theme unit test data", and you'll find a link to download some test content to your site.
