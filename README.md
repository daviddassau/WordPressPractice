# WordPress Practice

Hello! If you are David Dassau, welcome back! If you've stumbled upon these notes, here's what you need to know:

- I've created notes for a step-by-step process of getting set up with running Wordpress locally on your machine.
- For the most part, they are in the order you should go in when setting up your machine with WAMP (for Windows computers) or MAMP (for Mac computers).
- Once you get past the initial few steps, feel free to pick and chose witch things to do next.

### Happy Coding!!!
