# Using Github with your local Wordpress site

When using Github to manage your local Wordpress workflow and updates, there are a few important things to know.

One of the most important things is setting up your `.gitignore` file properly within your repo.
1. First, you need to visit https://ironcodestudio.com/bare-minimum-git/ and scroll down to where you see "Bare Minimum Git .gitignore files". Click on "WordPress .gitignore". Alternatively, you can just go directly to https://gist.github.com/salcode/9940509
