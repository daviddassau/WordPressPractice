## Instructions for migrating your local WordPress site to your host/server

### Step 1
1. Download the plugin [**Duplicator**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/)
2. Once installed, navigate to the Duplicator main page.
3. Click on **Create New** to create a new package.
4. Give your package a name, and feel free to add notes if you need/want to. When you're done, click **Next**.
5. Duplicator will run a system scan to help determine any potential issues. Once it's done, hit **Build** to create your package.
6. Now the plugin will begin backing up your site. Duplicator will produce two files for you:
  - An archive of your site, as a `.ZIP` file.
  - An installer file, as a `.PHP` file.
